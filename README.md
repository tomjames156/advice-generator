## Overview

This is an advice generator app. It generates a random advice each time the dice button is clicked. It was built with React.js, JSX, JavaScript, tailwindCSS and the AdviceSlip API.

### The challenge

Users should be able to:
- Generate new advice when they click the dice button
- See the size of the elements adjust based on their device's screen size

## My process

- I initialized the React App and added the tailwind dependencies for the app. 
- I made use of tailwindCSS for the styling of the app.
- I added the structure of the web app using JSX (JavasScript XML)
- I added the logic using JavaScript

### Built with

- JavaScript XML
- TailwindCSS classes
- Flexbox
- Desktop-first workflow

### What I learned

I learnt about the Context API and made use of it to store all the app's state like the generated advice. I also learnt about tailwindCSS classes which I used to create the styling of the app.
